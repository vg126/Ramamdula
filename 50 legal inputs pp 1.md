## Case Law Materials (15 inputs)

**Input 11**: [Case Law - Appeals Chamber Libya]
**Source**: The Prosecutor v. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, Appeals Chamber, 21 May 2014
**Text**: The Appeals Chamber was of the view that the Pre-Trial Chamber did not err in either fact or law when it concluded that Libya had fallen short of substantiating, by means of evidence of a sufficient degree of specificity and probative value, that Libya's investigation covers the same case that is before the Court.

---

**Input 12**: [Case Law - Pre-Trial Chamber Complementarity Test]
**Source**: ICC Pre-Trial Chamber jurisprudence on admissibility
**Text**: The Court has consistently required "substantially the same conduct" for a finding of parity between its own case and the case under investigation or prosecution by domestic authorities. Different outcomes in the Al-Senussi and Gaddafi cases are attributable to factual differences, leaving intact the fundamental approach of the Court to the "inability" and "unwillingness" aspects of complementarity.

---

**Input 13**: [Case Law - Appeals Chamber Two-Step Test]
**Source**: Appeals Chamber jurisprudence on admissibility
**Text**: The Appeals Chamber has consistently endorsed a "two-step analysis" for determining admissibility, firstly in Katanga, then followed in Bemba, Kenyatta, Ruto, Gaddafi, Al-Senussi, and now in Simone Gbagbo. The first step is to determine the existence of an "investigation or prosecution" at the domestic level. The second step is to address whether the State is "unwilling or unable genuinely" to investigate or prosecute.

---

**Input 14**: [Case Law - Kenya Admissibility Challenge]
**Source**: The Prosecutor v. William Samoei Ruto, Appeals Chamber
**Text**: Complementarity is a core guiding principle for the relationship between States and the Court is confirmed by its prominent place in the Statute (article 1 and Preamble) as well as by the drafting history of the Rome Statute. The "criminal jurisdiction" of the Court and that of States are "complementary" to each other.

---

**Input 15**: [Case Law - Burden of Proof]
**Source**: ICC Appeals Chamber jurisprudence
**Text**: A State that challenges the admissibility of a case bears the burden of proof to show that the case is inadmissible. In the absence of a statutory standard of proof, the jurisprudence has required "evidence of a sufficient degree of specificity and probative value."

---

**Input 16**: [Case Law - Temporal Assessment]
**Source**: Katanga Appeals Chamber Decision
**Text**: Admissibility must be determined "on the basis of the factual situation at the time of the proceedings concerning the admissibility challenge", not, for instance, at the time of the issuance of the warrant of arrest. The Statute assumes that the factual situation on the basis of which the admissibility of a case is established is not necessarily static, but ambulatory.

---

**Input 17**: [Case Law - Libya Inability Finding]
**Source**: The Prosecutor v. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, Pre-Trial Chamber
**Text**: Libya has shown to be unable to secure the transfer of Mr. Gaddafi from his place of detention under authority of the Zintan militia – a non State actor - to the custody of the Libyan authorities. The Pre-Trial Chamber was also not persuaded that the Libyan authorities had the capacity to obtain the necessary testimony and found that Libya had not shown whether and how it would overcome the difficulties in securing a lawyer for the suspect.

---

**Input 18**: [Case Law - Al-Senussi Inadmissibility]
**Source**: The Prosecutor v. Abdullah Al-Senussi, Pre-Trial Chamber
**Text**: The Pre-Trial Chamber I, while dismissing the challenge concerning Gaddafi, held the case against Al-Senussi inadmissible before the Court. The Appeals Chamber subsequently upheld both these holdings. This paper, carrying out a comparative analysis, points out the inconsistency affecting the two decisions, which is due to a conflicting assessment of the same element: Libya's failure to provide the accused with legal counsel.

---

**Input 19**: [Case Law - Simone Gbagbo Admissibility]
**Source**: The Prosecutor v. Simone Gbagbo, Appeals Chamber, 27 May 2015
**Text**: The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) delivered its judgment by which it rejected the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire's appeal and confirmed the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I's decision of 11 December 2014, which declared the case against Simone Gbagbo admissible before the Court.

---

**Input 20**: [Case Law - Inaction Scenario]
**Source**: ICC OTP Expert Paper on Complementarity
**Text**: The most straightforward scenario is where no State has initiated any investigation (the inaction scenario). In such a scenario, none of the alternatives of Arts. 17(1)(a)-(c) are satisfied and there is no impediment to admissibility. Thus, there is no need to examine the factors of unwillingness or inability; the case is simply admissible under the clear terms of Article 17.

---

**Input 21**: [Case Law - Unwillingness Assessment]
**Source**: ICC OTP Expert Paper on Complementarity
**Text**: An assessment of unwillingness will involve a search for indicia of a purpose of shielding the person from criminal responsibility or a lack of an intent to bring the person to justice. This may be inferred from: direct or indirect proof of political interference or deliberate obstruction and delay; general institutional deficiencies (political subordination of investigative, prosecutorial or judicial branch); procedural irregularities indicating a lack of willingness to genuinely investigate or prosecute.

---

**Input 22**: [Case Law - Inability Standard]
**Source**: ICC OTP Expert Paper on Complementarity
**Text**: The standard for showing inability should be a stringent one, as the ICC is not a human rights monitoring body, and its role is not to ensure perfect procedures and compliance with all international standards. The focus of the complementarity regime is on the more basic question of whether the State is unable to genuinely carry out a proceeding.

---

**Input 23**: [Case Law - Central African Republic Admissibility]
**Source**: ICC case law on admissibility determinations
**Text**: The Court shall determine that a case is inadmissible where the case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution. The assessment of unwillingness or inability therefore necessarily depends on investigative and prosecutorial activities by the State.

---

**Input 24**: [Case Law - Due Process and Complementarity]
**Source**: Libya Cases - Appeals Chamber reasoning
**Text**: The Court cannot find a State unwilling on the sole ground that the national proceedings violate due process. The chapeau and the three subparagraphs are conjunctive: the Court can only find a State unwilling if the national proceedings both violate international due process and satisfy one of the three conditions specified in Article 17(2).

---

**Input 25**: [Case Law - Same Person Same Conduct Test]
**Source**: ICC jurisprudence on case admissibility
**Text**: Libya has the burden to prove the two limbs of an admissibility determination, namely, that its domestic case covers the same person and substantially the same conduct, and that Libya is not unwilling and unable. The challenging State is required to substantiate all aspects of its allegations to the extent required by the concrete circumstances of the case.

## Procedural Documentation (10 inputs)

**Input 26**: [Prosecution Submission - Unwillingness]
**Source**: ICC Prosecution submissions on state unwillingness
**Text**: The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.

---

**Input 27**: [Defense Argument - Complementarity Challenge]
**Source**: Defense counsel complementarity arguments
**Text**: The defense contends that the ICC's current interpretation of complementarity negates the concerns raised by States at the Rome conference, defeats the principle's object and purpose and turns it on its head; the current regime -as developed by the Court's early practice is de iure one of complementarity, but de facto is nothing less than primacy of the ICC over national courts.

---

**Input 28**: [State Communication - Article 18 Notification]
**Source**: State responses to Article 18 notifications
**Text**: When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13(a) and the Prosecutor has determined that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the crimes concerned.

---

**Input 29**: [Prosecution Argument - Gravity Threshold]
**Source**: ICC Prosecution policy on gravity assessment
**Text**: The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. The ICC was established by its state parties as a court of limited jurisdiction, and those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity.

---

**Input 30**: [Defense Challenge - Burden of Proof]
**Source**: Defense arguments on admissibility burden
**Text**: The Appellant further argues that the Chamber reversed the burden of proof and required the Appellant to show Libya's unwillingness and inability rather than requiring Libya to provide evidence of the genuineness of its proceedings.

---

**Input 31**: [State Position - Complementarity Framework]
**Source**: State submissions on complementarity obligations
**Text**: The purpose of article 18(1) is to give States a fair and reasonable opportunity to know the scope of the Prosecution investigation that they are expected to "sufficiently mirror." This requires an article 18(1) notification that is "sufficiently specific," not only in relation to the intended investigation by the Prosecution at the time of the notice, but also as it relates to the investigation as it may subsequently be modified or expanded.

---

**Input 32**: [Prosecution Policy - Positive Complementarity]
**Source**: ICC OTP policy on positive complementarity
**Text**: The OTP's broad approach to PEs, as well as its strategies with respect to the selection, prioritization, hibernation, and closure of cases. Closely connected to these considerations is the question of "positive complementarity," which the report also addresses in some detail.

---

**Input 33**: [Defense Argument - Ne Bis in Idem]
**Source**: Defense submissions on double jeopardy
**Text**: No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis of this Statute shall be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.

---

**Input 34**: [State Communication - Cooperation Obligations]
**Source**: State responses to ICC cooperation requests
**Text**: According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling to genuinely carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators.

---

**Input 35**: [Prosecution Submission - Inability Assessment]
**Source**: ICC Prosecution arguments on state inability
**Text**: In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.

## Academic Analysis (10 inputs)

**Input 36**: [Academic Commentary - Complementarity Principle]
**Source**: Benzing, "The Complementarity Regime of the International Criminal Court"
**Text**: Bearing this in mind, it is clear why the principle of complementarity has been described as essential for the acceptance of the Statute by states. Apart from the jurisdictional regime established by the Statute, the principle of complementarity is the salient instrument to delineate the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC from that of national authorities.

---

**Input 37**: [Scholarly Analysis - Physical and Legal Inability]
**Source**: Academic analysis of Article 17(3)
**Text**: An indepth analysis of this article would show that the reason behind the inability of a national judicial system is attributed to one of two factors or even the two together; first, physical factors, in the case of 'total or substantial collapse', and second, legal factors, in the case of 'unavailability of national judicial system'.

---

**Input 38**: [Academic Commentary - Regional Complementarity]
**Source**: Academic analysis of complementarity interpretation
**Text**: On one side, it is firmly rooted in state sovereignty — it affirms states' primary role in exercising criminal jurisdiction over international crimes. On the other side, the principle of complementarity establishes a restrained role for the Court — what has been called one of 'last resort'.

---

**Input 39**: [Doctrinal Analysis - Unwillingness Criterion]
**Source**: Academic analysis of unwillingness provisions
**Text**: Article 17(2) of the Rome Statute states that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will possess jurisdiction over domestic proceedings when the state is deemed "unwilling" to prosecute. This dimension of the ICC's complementarity scheme has not yet been conceptualized by jurisprudence. This article will argue that the provision enshrining the unwillingness criterion is inherently vague.

---

**Input 40**: [Academic Commentary - Spectrum of Severity]
**Source**: Robinson et al., "The Rome Statute, Penalties & the Spectrum of Severity"
**Text**: Articles 17 and 20 of the Rome Statute should not be construed to permit re-trial at the ICC where the penalty imposed was at the appropriate place on that state's spectrum of severity. Where penalties are on the appropriate point of the society's punishment continuum, they should not be deemed inadequate, and therefore should not be said to be shielding the defendant.

---

**Input 41**: [Academic – Complementarity & State Sovereignty]  
**Source**: Sarah M. H. Nouwen, *Complementarity in the Line of Fire* (2013)  
**Text**: “Complementarity was deliberately framed to protect national sovereignty by giving domestic authorities the first opportunity to act, yet it simultaneously introduces an external benchmark of ‘genuineness’ that may expose shortcomings of national justice systems.” 

---

**Input 42**: [Academic – Two-Step Admissibility Test]  
**Source**: Carsten Stahn, *Admissibility Challenges before the ICC* (2014)  
**Text**: “Article 17 imposes a sequential inquiry: the Court must ascertain whether domestic proceedings concern ‘the same person and substantially the same conduct,’ and only thereafter examine unwillingness or inability.” 

---

**Input 43**: [Academic – Critique of Same-Conduct Requirement]  
**Source**: Kevin Jon Heller, “Mistakes in the ‘Same Conduct’ Test” (Opinio Juris, 2024)  
**Text**: “The rigid focus on identical conduct risks discouraging states from pursuing alternative charges that still reflect the seriousness of the crimes, thereby undermining the Statute’s preventive purpose.” 

---

**Input 44**: [Academic – Strengths & Weaknesses of Complementarity]  
**Source**: Linda E. Carter, “Complementarity as a Strength or a Weakness?” (Wash. U. Global Studies L. Rev. 2013)  
**Text**: “The built-in deference to national prosecutions respects state sovereignty but may diminish the Court’s authority; reframing success around capacity-building could convert this perceived weakness into a systemic strength.” 

---

**Input 45**: [Academic – Genuineness Benchmark]  
**Source**: Informal Expert Paper, *The Principle of Complementarity in Practice* (ICC, 2003)  
**Text**: “The qualifier ‘genuinely’ narrows the class of national proceedings that bar ICC action, ensuring that sham or hopelessly inadequate trials do not trigger inadmissibility.” 

---

**Input 46**: [Academic – Positive Complementarity Policy]  
**Source**: OTP, *Policy on Complementarity and Cooperation* (2024)  
**Text**: “The Office seeks to transform complementarity from a passive admissibility filter into an active strategy that encourages national authorities to investigate Rome Statute crimes through targeted assistance.” 

---

**Input 47**: [Academic – Gravity & Admissibility]  
**Source**: William A. Schabas, *The International Criminal Court: A Commentary on the Rome Statute*, 2nd ed. (2016)  
**Text**: “Even where complementarity is satisfied, Article 17(1)(d) empowers the Court to decline cases lacking sufficient gravity, underscoring that admissibility embodies both jurisdictional and policy considerations.” 

---

**Input 48**: [Academic – Complementarity in Non-Party Situations]  
**Source**: Brawijaya Law Journal, “ICC Jurisdiction over Alleged Crimes in Palestine” (2024)  
**Text**: “The study concludes that the absence of genuine Israeli investigations activates the ICC’s last-resort mandate despite Israel’s non-party status, illustrating complementarity’s functional rather than formal character.” 

---

**Input 49**: [Academic – Reverse Complementarity Critique]  
**Source**: Padjadjaran Journal Int’l Law, “Reversed Implementation of Complementarity in the Argentine Rohingya Case” (2023)  
**Text**: “Applying complementarity to block a universal-jurisdiction investigation because the ICC is already seized contradicts the Statute’s duty-to-prosecute logic and lacks support in international law.” 

---

**Input 50**: [Academic – Ne Bis in Idem & Complementarity]  
**Source**: ICC Filing ICC-01/11-01/11-384-Red-Corr (2013) quoting Holmes & El Zeidy  
**Text**: “Scholars regard Article 20’s *ne bis in idem* guarantee as a ‘special aspect of complementarity,’ linking the bar on double jeopardy to the same overarching objective of preventing impunity while respecting national efforts.”
